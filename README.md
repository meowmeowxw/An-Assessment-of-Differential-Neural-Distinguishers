# Additional scripts

The class that implements a vectorized version of DES is [des_vectorized:DESV](./cipher/des_vectorised.py)

To evaluate DES with 3-Rounds run:

```py
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 ./eval_desv.py
```

The models are in [./freshly_trained_nets](./freshly_trained_nets/).

Modify the source in [train_desv.py](./train_desv.py) specifying the distinguisher and number of rounds to train the model.

## Requirements
The python code was tested using Python 3.9.12 and the packages from requirements.txt.
Some experiments require up to 32GB of RAM. This can be prevented by lowering the n_samples* values, but comes at the expense of less precise results.

For experiments using the neural networks from ZWWW22, those network first need to be downloaded from the URL provided in https://github.com/CryptAnalystDesigner/NeuralDistingsuisherWithInception/blob/main/model_file_download_address.txt and then be put into the directory ZWWW22 (the directory ZWWW22 should then contain the two subdirectories Speck3264 and Simon3264).
